# python-api-challenge
This repo uses Python script to visualize weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. This is accomplished by using the citipy python library and the OpenWeatherMap API. The weather data visualization is then used to plan future vacations using jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API.
